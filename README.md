Surrounded by mountains, Rutland is one of the largest cities of the state of Vermont. It is a short drive from Killington Mountain Resort and the Green Mountain National forest. In addition, Rutland has trails for both hiking and mountain biking less than 15 minutes from downtown. This would appear to be the perfect scenario to practice and enjoy all kinds of action sports, and for some, it is. But a large number of Rutland's residents are unable to participate in the activities existing right outside their backdoors. 

## Rutland By The Numbers
Almost 20% of Rutland has a median household income of between 10 and 20 thousand dollars a year. In addition, 14% of Rutland makes between 20 and 30 thousand dollars a year. With the average cost of living in Vermont being 35 thousand dollars a year, this leaves a huge portion of Rutland's population struggling to make ends meet.

## The Cost of Recreation

Rutland is close to a variety of recreational opportunities like Killington Resort so one might assume that the local population would frequently utilize them. However, Rutland residents looking to get into an activity like skiing or snowboarding may find that the initial investment of around 1000$ for their own gear, is far too high. Summer alternatives like mountain biking can be almost as expensive at over 800$ for your own gear. While other cheaper forms of recreation like hiking exist, a large portion of the area's well known recreational activities remain out of reach.
