## Introduction

Surrounded by mountains, Rutland is found one of the largest cities of the state of Vermont. It is a short drive from Killington Mountain Resort and the Green Mountain National forest. In addition, Rutland has trails for both hiking and mountain biking less than 15 minutes from downtown. This would appeaer to be the perfect scenario to practice and enjoy all kinds of action sports, and for some, it is. But with almost 20% of households in Rutland having an income of between 10,000$ and 20,000$, this isn't true for everyone. Many of Rutland's residents don't make enough money to be able to utilize the opportunities for recreation in their own county.

This was aimed at begginers who are not looking to spend more than they have to. However, we chose to only include the prices of brand new gear with reputable name-brands behind them (the brands are shown in parenthesis).
